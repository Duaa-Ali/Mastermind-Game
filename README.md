# Youth's-Inn-Management-System
 The Youth's Inn Management System, crafted in Java, expertly combines Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts such as Linked Lists with core aspects of File Handling and Inheritance. This project marries DSA with Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements to offer an aesthetically pleasing and efficient hostel management system. Its features include reservations, room assignments, additional services, and an admin login interface.

INTRODUCTION:
Color guessing games (also called deductive games or searching games) is a game
of two players in which the first player, usually referred to as the codemaker, chooses 
a secret code of six number, and the second player, usually referred to as the 
codebreaker, strives to reveal the code through a series of experiments that give him 
partial information about the code. An example of a code-breaking game is the 
famous board game. In this game, the codemaker creates a puzzle for the 
codebreaker by choosing a combination of four colored pegs (with color repetitions 
allowed). The codebreaker makes guesses about the colors, which are evaluated by 
the codemaker with different markers. A smilies corresponds to a position where the 
code and the guess match. A colored smilie marker means that some color is present 
both in the code and in the guess but at different positions.


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
As mentioned above, our game is a multi-player game. This allows the user to either 
play this game against the computer or they can choose any of their pals to be the 
opponent. 
One person writes a sequence which is unknown to the other, and that person has to 
guess the sequence/ pattern within 9 tries or their opponent wins.
In this game, the player will be challenged to guess a sequence of colors chosen by 
the computer/ the other player. The computer/opponent will provide feedback on the 
player's guesses, indicating how many colors are correct and in the correct position 
and how many colors are correct but in the wrong position. The player must use this 
feedback to deduce the correct sequence of colors. The game will have a set number 
of rounds, and the player's score will be based on how quickly they are able to 
correctly guess the sequence.
